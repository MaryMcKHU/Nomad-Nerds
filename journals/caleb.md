* With Arthur screen sharing, our group worked together to integrate the yelp api into our project
* We initially had a business model that we were working on but ultimately agreed that we only needed the Favorite and User models for now. 
* Now that we're working with a list of favorites from a user, we want to sort the list from highest and most rated.
* One big thing is that we are limited to 5000 requests per day, so we have to find a middle ground regarding to how big of a list we want to show to the user.

* Today, I did a lot of front end, playing around with different background pictures and title fonts that would look good with the rest of the website. I changed some of the color scheme of the navbar and footer. I found that adding too much color can make things worse.
